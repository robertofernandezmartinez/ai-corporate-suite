# 🔭 Perspective: The Operational Bridge
Most AI projects remain as isolated Jupyter Notebooks. **AI Corporate Suite** is a production-grade bridge that connects Data Science with industrial operations. 

This platform doesn't just "predict"; it **monitors, persists, and alerts**. It is a decoupled ecosystem (FastAPI + Streamlit + Supabase) designed to transform raw sensor and retail data into immediate executive action.

### 🧩 Applied AI Modules
The platform currently includes three applied AI modules that also exist as standalone projects separately:

- **SmartPort** — Maritime operational risk prediction
    - [Standalone Project Repository](https://github.com/robertofernandezmartinez/smartport-ai-risk-early-warning)
- **Stockout** — Retail inventory stockout prediction
    - [Standalone Project Repository](https://github.com/robertofernandezmartinez/retail-stockout-risk-scoring)
- **NASA RUL** — Predictive maintenance and Remaining Useful Life estimation
    - [Standalone Project Repository](https://github.com/robertofernandezmartinez/cmapss-rul-prediction)

# ⚡ Why this project matters (Value Proposition)

### 🔔 Proactive Intelligence
The system is **active, not passive**. When data is uploaded, the engines run inference in milliseconds. If a **CRITICAL** risk is detected, the system pushes an automated alert to the **Telegram Bot**. No one needs to be staring at a dashboard to know that an engine is failing or a warehouse is empty.

### 🛡️ Production-Ready Guardrails
Built for the "real world" where data is messy. Every engine includes a **Data Guardrail** layer that validates CSV schemas before inference. If the input is corrupt or columns are missing, the API rejects it with clear technical feedback instead of crashing.

### 🤖 Multi-Channel Interface
- **Streamlit UI:** Specialized dashboards for deep-dive historical analysis.
- **FastAPI Swagger:** A professional technical interface for external system integration.
- **Telegram Bot:** A conversational bridge for quick status checks and real-time push alerts.

# 🏗️ Architecture & Flow
The platform follows a modern, decoupled architecture:
1. **Frontend (Streamlit):** Executive reporting and manual uploads.
2. **Backend (FastAPI):** High-performance inference engine with multithreaded services.
3. **Persistence (Supabase):** PostgreSQL storage for batch tracking and historical auditing.

**The Data Lifecycle:**
`Raw Data Upload` ➔ `Schema Validation` ➔ `ML Inference` ➔ `DB Persistence` ➔ `Proactive Alerting` ➔ `Dashboard Refresh`

# 🚀 Quick Start for Recruiters
1. **Open the [Interactive API Docs](/docs).**
2. Select a module, for example: `POST /stockout/upload`.
3. Click **"Try it out"** and upload a [Demo CSV](data/raw/).
4. Click **"Execute"**: You will receive a structured JSON response and a Telegram push notification in real-time.
